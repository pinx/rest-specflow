# SpecFlow for ASP.NET integration testing

In the Specs project, the desired features of the API are described in [Gherkin](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow/en/latest/Gherkin/Gherkin-Reference.html).

The code behind a feature spec is described in Steps.

The API can be started itself, and tested in the browser manually by visiting https://localhost:44393/orders

The tests can be run from the Visual Studio test explorer.
